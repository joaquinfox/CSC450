Java methods related to reading files:

- character streams: use to reach 16 bit characters (unicode). Method names end with Reader/Writer

- byte streams: use to read binary, or other data that is not unicode. Method names end in InputStream/OutputStream

- for efficiency wrap streams in a buffer reader/writer.
- close streams.
- binary data means "not text". stuff like .png




   -  BufferReader (java.io.BufferReader) reads text from a stream and is used to wrap a reader method
        such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders
        Without buffering, each invocation of read() or readLine() could cause bytes
        to be read from the file, converted into characters, and then returned, which
        can be very inefficient.
     
    - InputStreamReader
