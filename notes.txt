- ? difference between safety and reliability and secure? are these just redundant terms?
- ? why are we studying C++ ?
1.5
- structured programming
    - top down
    - not reusable
    - focusses on instructions, not data structures
- OO is bottom up
    - modular
        -  information hiding
        - data is hidden inside of modules and subroutines are provided to interact with that data
    - objects are modules
        - containe data and subroutines
        - a self sufficient entity with internal state
        - responds to messages/ calls to its subroutines
        - begin by identifying objects
    - polymorphism
        - different objects can respond to the same message in different ways
        

The square bracket
operator is not range-checked and thus reading from or writing to an out-of-bounds index
tends to produce difficult-to-track-down errors.

POINTERS & REFERENCES
- pointers: a variable that holds a memory address of another variable
    - *p
- references: an alias or another name for an existing variable.
    can be thought of as a constant pointer. References are implemented internally as pointers.

both references and pointers store the name of an existing object.
