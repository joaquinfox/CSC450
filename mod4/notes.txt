Module 4: Discussion Forum

In creating C++ applications, you have the ability to utilize various formatting functions in the iostream library.  What are some of the formatting vulnerabilities that can be encountered in using the iostream library in C++?  What tips can be utilized to identify these vulnerabilities?  Be sure to provide an appropriate source code example to illustrate your points.

The IOStream library is C++'s way of formatting input and output to a variety of sources susch as the console, files, or string buffers.

Has a bunch of manipulators <iomanip>

One thing I have been unclear about up untill this module, is that the IOStream library in C++ has more functionality than we get just by importing the <iostream> module. That include gives us only a subset of the methods available in the larger IOStream library, namely cout and cin. Other cool stuff availbale includes:
- stream minipulators, accessed with <iomanip>
    - endl;
    - boolalpha;
    - setw(n);
    - hex, dec, oct
        cout<<dec<<10<<endl;
    - ws (skips whitespace);

    Error states: end-of-file, fail state, bad state.
