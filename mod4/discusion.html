  Before answering this, I had to first understand the IOStream library better.
  It turns out that when we include
  <code style="color: black">iostream</code>
  we <em>do not</em> include the full IOStream library, only a subset of that
  library. What <code style="color: black">iostream</code>
  gives us are the console operations<code
    style="color: black"
    > cout, cin </code
  >and<code style="color: black"> cer</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Other tools of the IOStream library have to be pulled into your code
  separately. These include all the stream manipulators, accesed with
  <code style="color: black">iomanip</code>. This package includes some of the most useful tools for formating output, such as
  <ul>
      <li>
          Setting output buffer width with <code style="color: black">setw(2)</code>


      </li>
      <li>
          Padding output with <code style="color: black">setfill("0")</code>


      </li>
      <li>
          Setting output precision with <code style="color: black">precision(n)</code>


      </li>
      <li>
Changing number bases with, for example: <pre>

  <code style="color: black">cout<< hex<<7849568 </code>
</pre>


      </li>
  
  </ul>
  File read - write methods are
  accessed with<code style="color: black"> fstream </code> header. Here is a
  diagram of the full architecture of the IOStream library which I found
  helpful. At each level of the diagram, a given class will have the functoinality (methods) of the classes <em>above it</em>(the parent classes), and will also have the methods of <em>adjacent</em> classes, but it will not have the functionality of classes <em>lower down</em> on the inheritance chart.

 There are lots of vulnerabilities related to I/O, described in the SEI CERT. All of chapter 8 is dedicated to I/O issues and they come up in other chapters as well. I think we can  group all of these issues into two main areas 
 by data <em>type</em> and data <em>length</em> mismatches.
</p>
<p>
  With type mismatches we expect a certain input, say integers, but we get
  another, say strings. For example If I ask for an age and expect it as an integer ...
</p>
<pre><code>
  int age;
  cout<<"Enter your age:";
  cin>> age;
</code></pre>
<p>... but a user inputs a string <code style="color: black">"Older n dirt"</code>, the stream enters a fail state which breaks the stream and shuts down so that any furthuer call to <code style="color: black">cin</code> will fail as well.
 </p>
<p>Another failure category is related to the size of data, and this forms the core of the integer overflow problems affectig ethereum smart contracts(citation). I don't understand how these contracts, or ethereum work, but apparently they use integers to encode data, and since int has a finite size (in any language), it is easy to break an integer and lose data. Here is an example of an integer overflow in C++. </p>
<pre><code>
  int mySecretNumber = 2147483647;
  cout << mySecretNumber * 2;
  // Output: -2
</code></pre>
<p>The good news is all of these conditions are known and can be defended against. Methods at our disposal include validating inputs before using them in a process, and wrapping critical code in a <code style="color: black">try - catch</code> to catch and handle any exceptions that surface.
