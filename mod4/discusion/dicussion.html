    what is the difference between ifstream and fstream and ofstream?

These are the three basic I/O classes that relate to files in C++.If we want to perform some operation to files we would instantiate fstream along with the stream object we wanted. For example to create and write files we could write: <code style="color:black">#include fstream, iostream</code> in the header. This will give us acces to the methods of iostream so that we can use outf to touch and write a file.
<pre><code>
    #include <fstream>
    #include <iostream>
        
        using namespace std;
        
        int main()
        {
            ofstream outf("testFoo.txt");
        
        
            outf << "Eat more cheetoz."
                 << "\n";
            outf << "Cheetoz are delicious."
                 << "\n";
            return 0;
        }
</code></pre>
<p>Just as outf allows us to write to a file, inf allows us to read from a file.
    <pre><code>
        #include <fstream>
        #include <iostream>
        #include <string>
            
            using namespace std;
            
            int main()
            {
                ifstream inf{"testFoo.txt"};
            
                while (inf)
                { // As long as there is something in the file, keep reading.
                    string strInput;
                    getline(inf, strInput);
            
                    cout << strInput << "\n";
                }
            
                return 0;
            }

    </code></pre>

<p>These filestream objects have unique security implications. One is that they are not disposed of immediately when a calling file closes. Instead they are <em>buffered</em> or held for batching. When the file closses normally, the buffered contents are written to disk and persisted. 
If a program crashes suddenly these buffered filestreams are never written to disk, and the data is lost. </p>
