<p>
  C++ uses two basic (and different) namespaces for approaching strings. The
  first is the approach inherited from the C language, of treating strings as
  arrays of characters, with a null value stuck on the end. As a reminder, C++
  is a superset of C and implements all of the methods of the
  <a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/cpp-history">older language</a> . When
  approaching strings in this way, all the methods we perform are carried out on
  individual character elements.
</p>
<p>
  The second approach to C++ has towards strings, makes use of a String class,
  with a toolbox of useful string methods. This conception of a string is closer
  to that of Java, and the available methods are similar. These objects are
  dynamically allocated, and so less wasteful of space.
</p>
<p>
  Why would one use a character array as opposed to the string class? The only
  argument I found for this, is that character arrays can be
  <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stdstring-class-in-c/">faster</a>. On
  the other hand, character arrays have the disadvantage of being statically
  sized, wasteful of space, and in my opinion, tedious to work with. This week's
  chapter in Structured Programming in C++ (chapter 5) focussed entirely on
  character arrays, and as far as I could tell, does not even mention the string
  class.
</p>
<p>
  Both approaches come with security concerns. Before I get into that though,
  let me clear up something that has confused me, as to the meaning of security.
  The word is used to describe very different things, namely the privacy of
  data, the integrity of data, and the stability of the program(Gasser, Morrie,
  Building a secure computer system, Chapter 1). I think of these as "stealing
  stuff" vs. "changing stuff" vs "breaking stuff". The security issues described
  in chapter 6 of SEI CERT are mostly of the "breaking stuff" sort. It is hard
  to see, for example, how a buffer overflow could be used to do more than crash
  a program. If I am wrong about this (and I very well could be ) please correct
  me.
</p>
<p>
  You may have found as I did, that many of the "non-compliant" code samples in
  chapter 6 compile and execute just fine, which is of course why they are hard
  to spot and so problematic. This begs the question of whether C++ is not just
  fundamentally flawed from a security standpoint.
</p>
<p>
  Onto specific vulnerabilities. Here is a character array, and some code that
  shows its main vulnerability.
</p>
<pre><code>
        int main()
        {
            char foo[4] = {'f', 'o', 'o', '\0'};
            cout &lt;&lt; "String length:" &lt;&lt; strlen(foo) &lt;&lt; endl;
            cout &lt;&lt; foo[5] &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; foo[6] &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; foo[7] &lt;&lt; endl;
        }
        
        /*OUTPUTS 
        String length: 3
        qf
        M# 
        L +
        */
    </code></pre>
<p>
  String foo's length is declared to be 4, but its available length, given by
  <code>strlen(foo)</code> is 3. Accessing memory areas outside of the array
  (beyond index 4) results in accessing random areas of memory, and returning
  junk. The output above shows some sample output. The recommended solution (and
  I love this) is <em>not to use character arrays</em>(SEI CERT, 6.1.3)
</p>
<p>
  The string class has its own host of vulnerabilities, and these are classified
  by the SEI into 4 groups as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <em>Size and space issues</em>. This is where we try to add to a full
    string, as above. The consequences here are buffer overloads and (in my case
    at least) a program crash. As we saw above, these errors are unchecked at
    compile time and can sneak by undetected.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Trying to make a string from an empty pointer</em>. You can have an
    empty string. But you can't have a null string.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Goofing up your pointers</em>. We haven't delved much into pointers and
    references, but the SEI code samples are thick with them so hopefully, we
    have all had a chance to make some sense of these.
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>Out of range related</em>. Those of us coming out of recent Java classes
    know this one well.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Most of these problem categories lead to undefined behavior or buffer
  overflows, putting them in my "break stuff" category of security
  vulnerabilities.
</p>
<p>
  Turning to STR52 6.3.2 a few thoughts. If you had trouble, like I did, reading
</p>
<pre><code>
    void f(const std::string &amp;input)
 </code></pre>
<p>Here is a translation:</p>
<pre><code>
    void f(const string &amp;input)
 </code></pre>
<p>
  Where &amp;input is a reference type, to string variable you might initialize
  as follows:
</p>
<pre><code>
    string input = "hanga;banga;boom";
    string &amp;p = input;
 </code></pre>
<p>Here is a derivation of 6.3.2 I had to work up for my own comprehension.</p>
<pre><code>
    using namespace std;
    #include 
    #include 
    void f(const string &amp;input)
    {
        std::string email;
        cout &lt;&lt; "BEFORE: " &lt;&lt; input &lt;&lt; endl;
        // Copy input into email converting ";" to " "
        string::iterator loc = email.begin();
        for (auto i = input.begin(), e = input.end(); i != e; ++i, ++loc)
        {
            loc = email.insert(loc, *i != ';' ? *i : ' ');
        }
        cout &lt;&lt; "AFTER: " &lt;&lt; email &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
    
    int main()
    {
        string input = "hanga;banga;boom";
        string &amp;p = input;
        f(p);
    }
    
    /*OUTPUTS
    BEFORE: hanga;banga;boom
    AFTER: hanga banga boom
    */
