- ?undefined behaviors/undefined programs
- ? difference between safety and reliability and secure? are these just redundant terms?
- ? why are we studying C++ ?
1.5
- structured programming
    - top down
    - not reusable
    - focusses on instructions, not data structures
- OO is bottom up
    - modular
        -  information hiding
        - data is hidden inside of modules and subroutines are provided to interact with that data
    - objects are modules
        - containe data and subroutines
        - a self sufficient entity with internal state
        - responds to messages/ calls to its subroutines
        - begin by identifying objects
    - polymorphism
        - different objects can respond to the same message in different ways
        
Business Use Case (is a class)
- a business use case is a process of a business.
- it describes a specific workflow
- describes what should happen
- it either generates value or mitigates cost.
    - not too much, not too little
- similar workflows grouped together in a class
- a BUC focuses on a single actor
- the external view of a BUC is for people outside the BUC (but still in the business)
- the internal view of the BUC is for people inside the BUC (called the BUC Realizations)

- in deciding if a servise is a use case, ask if it generates value in and of itself. If not, it is a step in a larger use case.
