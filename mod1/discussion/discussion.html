  I am using VSCODE as my text editor for this, and all of my CSC classes so
  far. I was already familiar with VSCODE, and it seems able to give me all
  features I need to write in C++ and Java. One distinguishing feature of VSCODE
  is that it is command-line based, as opposed to Eclipse with its GUI
  interface.

<p>
  From Peggy Fisher's video (<em>C++ Essential Training for Career Changers</em
  >), C++ has the same menu of data types we have used in Java, that is,
  strings, characters, boolean, and number types for integers and rational
  values of various precisions and lengths. In addition, C++ uses pointer and
  reference types, which is not something we had to work with in Java, but I
  gather are used to manually allocate and de-allocate memory, (which is
  something the Java Virtual Machine does for us). For more on pointers and
  their use see <em>Pointers in C++ with Examples</em> (GeeksForGeeks).
</p>
<p>
  Similar to Java, C++ has the concept of primitive data types (integers,
  characters, booleans, floating points, double floats, void, and wide chars),
  as well as a concept of derived data types (which sound to me a bit like
  collections of primitive types, for example, an array). In C++ the concept of
  abstract data types seems to have a somewhat different meaning than it does in
  Java. For those of us who took CSC400, the phrase abstract data type brings to
  mind things like bags, stacks, queues, and heaps. In C++ the term seems to
  refer to anything user-defined, such as a class.
</p>
<p>
  I am not clear on the relationship of data types and security, beyond the
  basic idea that if a data type is compromised its value can be altered and
  that can be used to do bad things. But the mechanics of how this can happen is
  very unclear to me. Hopefully one of you can better explain this.
</p>
<p>
  As with Java, C++ is flexible as to how we declare and initialize variable
  types. Here are some examples:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>bool quit = false;</li>
  <li>int age {48};</li>
  <li>string foo = "Eat beans";</li>
  <li>char code = 'X';</li>
  <li>double rate = 0.05;</li>
</ul>
<p>
  C++ has the ability to infer data types, and this seems like a useful semantic
  tool. To have C++ infer a data type we use the keyword
 <code style="color:rgb(59, 55, 55)">auto</code> The two variable
  declarations below will be compiled as an integer in the first case, and as a
  double in the second:
</p>
    <p>
        <code style="color:rgb(59, 55, 55)">auto numA {10};</code>
    </p>
    <p>
        <code style="color:rgb(59, 55, 55)">auto numB {10.0};</code>
    </p>
<p>
  In the same video referenced above, vectors and arrays are described as
  additional data types in C++, although I am used to thinking of these as
  <em>data structures</em> that contain data.
